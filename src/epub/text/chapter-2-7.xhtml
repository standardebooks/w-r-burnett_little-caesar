			<p>Rico bought all the papers he could find and went up to his room to read them. He sat at his table, his hat tilted over his eyes, with a pair of scissors in his hand, cutting from the papers all the articles dealing with the holdup and the killing of Police Captain Courtney. He arranged the clippings in a neat pile, then read them over and over.</p>
			<p>One said:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>… the thug who shot Police Captain Courtney was a small, pale foreigner, probably an Italian. He was dressed in a natty overcoat and a light felt hat.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Another:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>… Courtney’s murderer was described by one eyewitness as a small, unhealthy-looking foreigner.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Rico tore up this clipping.</p>
			<p>“Where do they get that unhealthy stuff!” he said. “I never been sick a day in my life.”</p>
